# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project implements and compares various machine learning classification algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, making it a suitable challenge to evaluate model robustness and performance metrics beyond accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Preprocess and explore the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
  
- Apply classification algorithms:
  
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
    
- Evaluate model performance using:
  
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Specificity
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve & AUC
 
## ðŸ§  Libraries Used

  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Each model's performance is analyzed and compared using various metrics and visualizations. The ROC curves and confusion matrices help identify strengths and weaknesses of each model when dealing with class imbalance.
